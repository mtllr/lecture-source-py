In addition to whatâ€™s in Anaconda, this lecture will need the following libraries:

.. code-block:: ipython

    !pip install --upgrade pandas-datareader

Overview
============

`Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ is a package of fast, efficient data analysis tools for Python.

Its popularity has surged in recent years, coincident with the rise
of fields such as data science and machine learning.

Here's a popularity comparison over time against STATA and SAS, courtesy of Stack Overflow Trends

.. figure:: /_static/lecture_specific/pandas/pandas_vs_rest.png


Just as `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ provides the basic array data type plus core array operations, pandas

#. defines fundamental structures for working with data and

#. endows them with methods that facilitate operations such as

    * reading in data

    * adjusting indices

    * working with dates and time series

    * sorting, grouping, re-ordering and general data munging [#mung]_

    * dealing with missing values, etc., etc.

More sophisticated statistical functionality is left to other packages, such
as `statsmodels <http://www.statsmodels.org/>`__ and `scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org/>`__, which are built on top of pandas.


This lecture will provide a basic introduction to pandas.

Throughout the lecture, we will assume that the following imports have taken
place

.. code-block:: ipython

    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    %matplotlib inline
    import requests

Series
======

.. index::
    single: Pandas; Series

Two important data types defined by pandas are  ``Series`` and ``DataFrame``.



You can think of a ``Series`` as a "column" of data, such as a collection of observations on a single variable.

A ``DataFrame`` is an object for storing related columns of data.

Let's start with `Series`

.. code-block:: python3

    s = pd.Series(np.random.randn(4), name='daily returns')
    s


Here you can imagine the indices ``0, 1, 2, 3`` as indexing four listed
companies, and the values being daily returns on their shares.

Pandas ``Series`` are built on top of NumPy arrays and support many similar
operations

.. code-block:: python3

    s * 100

.. code-block:: python3

    np.abs(s)

But ``Series`` provide more than NumPy arrays.

Not only do they have some additional (statistically oriented) methods

.. code-block:: python3

    s.describe()

But their indices are more flexible

.. code-block:: python3

    s.index = ['AMZN', 'AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOG']
    s

Viewed in this way, ``Series`` are like fast, efficient Python dictionaries
(with the restriction that the items in the dictionary all have the same
type---in this case, floats).

In fact, you can use much of the same syntax as Python dictionaries

.. code-block:: python3

    s['AMZN']

.. code-block:: python3

    s['AMZN'] = 0
    s

.. code-block:: python3

    'AAPL' in s


DataFrames
==========

.. index::
    single: Pandas; DataFrames

While a ``Series`` is a single column of data, a ``DataFrame`` is several columns, one for each variable.

In essence, a ``DataFrame`` in pandas is analogous to a (highly optimized) Excel spreadsheet.

Thus, it is a powerful tool for representing and analyzing data that are naturally organized  into rows and columns, often with  descriptive indexes for individual rows and individual columns.

    Let's look at an example that reads data from the CSV file ``pandas/data/test_pwt.csv`` that can be downloaded
    :download:`here <_static/lecture_specific/pandas/data/test_pwt.csv>`.

    Let's look at an example that reads data from the CSV file ``pandas/data/test_pwt.csv`` and can be downloaded
    `here <https://lectures.quantecon.org/_downloads/pandas/data/test_pwt.csv>`__.

Here's the content of ``test_pwt.csv``

Supposing you have this data saved as `test_pwt.csv` in the present working directory (type `%pwd` in Jupyter to see what this is), it can be read in as follows:


.. code-block:: python3

    df = pd.read_csv('https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.lectures.code/raw/master/pandas/data/test_pwt.csv')
    type(df)

.. code-block:: python3

    df


We can select particular rows using standard Python array slicing notation

.. code-block:: python3

    df[2:5]

To select columns, we can pass a list containing the names of the desired columns represented as strings

.. code-block:: python3

    df[['country', 'tcgdp']]

To select both rows and columns using integers, the ``iloc`` attribute should be used with the format ``.iloc[rows, columns]``

.. code-block:: python3

    df.iloc[2:5, 0:4]

To select rows and columns using a mixture of integers and labels, the ``loc`` attribute can be used in a similar way

.. code-block:: python3

    df.loc[df.index[2:5], ['country', 'tcgdp']]

Let's imagine that we're only interested in population and total GDP (``tcgdp``).

One way to strip the data frame ``df`` down to only these variables is to overwrite the dataframe using the selection method described above

.. code-block:: python3

    df = df[['country', 'POP', 'tcgdp']]
    df

Here the index ``0, 1,..., 7`` is redundant because we can use the country names as an index.

To do this, we set the index to be the ``country`` variable in the dataframe

.. code-block:: python3

    df = df.set_index('country')
    df

Let's give the columns slightly better names

.. code-block:: python3

    df.columns = 'population', 'total GDP'
    df

Population is in thousands, let's revert to single units

.. code-block:: python3

    df['population'] = df['population'] * 1e3
    df

Next, we're going to add a column showing real GDP per capita, multiplying by 1,000,000 as we go because total GDP is in millions

.. code-block:: python3

    df['GDP percap'] = df['total GDP'] * 1e6 / df['population']
    df

One of the nice things about pandas ``DataFrame`` and ``Series`` objects is that they have methods for plotting and visualization that work through Matplotlib.

For example, we can easily generate a bar plot of GDP per capita

.. code-block:: python3

    df['GDP percap'].plot(kind='bar')
    plt.show()

At the moment the data frame is ordered alphabetically on the countries---let's change it to GDP per capita

.. code-block:: python3

    df = df.sort_values(by='GDP percap', ascending=False)
    df

Plotting as before now yields

.. code-block:: python3

  df['GDP percap'].plot(kind='bar')
  plt.show()



On-Line Data Sources
====================

.. index::
    single: Data Sources

Python makes it straightforward to query online databases programmatically.

An important database for economists is `FRED <https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/>`_ --- a vast collection of time series data maintained by the St. Louis Fed.

For example, suppose that we are interested in the `unemployment rate <https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/UNRATE>`_.

Via FRED, the entire series for the US civilian unemployment rate can be downloaded directly by entering
this URL into your browser (note that this requires an internet connection)

.. code-block:: none

    https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/UNRATE/downloaddata/UNRATE.csv

(Equivalently, click here: https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/UNRATE/downloaddata/UNRATE.csv)

This request returns a CSV file, which will be handled by your default application for this class of files.

Alternatively, we can access the CSV file from within a Python program.

This can be done with a variety of methods.

We start with a relatively low-level method and then return to pandas.

Accessing Data with :index:`requests`
-------------------------------------

.. index::
    single: Python; requests

One option is to use `requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/>`_, a standard Python library for requesting data over the Internet.

To begin, try the following code on your computer

.. code-block:: python3

    r = requests.get('http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/UNRATE/downloaddata/UNRATE.csv')

If there's no error message, then the call has succeeded.

If you do get an error, then there are two likely causes

#. You are not connected to the Internet --- hopefully, this isn't the case.

#. Your machine is accessing the Internet through a proxy server, and Python isn't aware of this.

In the second case, you can either

* switch to another machine

* solve your proxy problem by reading `the documentation <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/>`_

Assuming that all is working, you can now proceed to use the ``source`` object returned by the call ``requests.get('http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/UNRATE/downloaddata/UNRATE.csv')``

.. code-block:: python3

    url = 'http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/UNRATE/downloaddata/UNRATE.csv'
    source = requests.get(url).content.decode().split("\n")
    source[0]

.. code-block:: python3

    source[1]

.. code-block:: python3

    source[2]

We could now write some additional code to parse this text and store it as an array.

But this is unnecessary --- pandas' ``read_csv`` function can handle the task for us.

We use ``parse_dates=True`` so that pandas recognizes our dates column, allowing for simple date filtering

.. code-block:: python3

    data = pd.read_csv(url, index_col=0, parse_dates=True)

The data has been read into a pandas DataFrame called ``data`` that we can now manipulate in the usual way

.. code-block:: python3

    type(data)

.. code-block:: python3

    data.head()  # A useful method to get a quick look at a data frame


.. code-block:: python3

    pd.set_option('precision', 1)
    data.describe()  # Your output might differ slightly

We can also plot the unemployment rate from 2006 to 2012 as follows

.. code-block:: python3

    data['2006':'2012'].plot()
    plt.show()

Please note pandas offers many other file type alternatives than reading csv data from the web. Pandas has `a wide variety <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html>`_ of top-level methods that we can use to read, excel, json, parquet or plug straight into a database server. With the advent of the internet and its lingua franca being json, we find it particularly easy to retrieve and utilize custom data sources. For instance an Italian governmental source can be acquired in 3 lines of code:

.. code-block:: python3

	url = "http://www.statweb.provincia.tn.it/indicatoristrutturali/exp.aspx?fmt=json&idind=102&t=n"
	json = requests.get(url).json()
	df = pd.DataFrame(json['Spesa pubblica totale'])
	df.head()

Using :index:`pandas_datareader` to access data
-----------------------------------------------

.. index::
    single: Python; pandas-datareader

The maker of pandas has also authored a library that gives programmatic access to many data sources straight from the jupyter notebook. Some sources might require an access key and some are premium sources but among the most important, such as FRED, OECD, EUROSTAT and the World Bank are free to use. We recommend consulting the `documentation <https://pandas-datareader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ for a detailed view how to
access the sources.

Let's work through one example of downloading and plotting data --- this
time from the World Bank.

The World Bank `collects and organizes data <http://data.worldbank.org/indicator>`_ on a huge range of indicators.

For example, `here's <http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GC.DOD.TOTL.GD.ZS/countries>`__ some data on government debt as a ratio to GDP.

The next code example fetches the data for you and plots time series for the US and Australia

.. code-block:: python3

    from pandas_datareader import wb

    govt_debt = wb.download(indicator='GC.DOD.TOTL.GD.ZS', country=['US', 'AU'], start=2005, end=2016).stack().unstack(0)
    ind = govt_debt.index.droplevel(-1)
    govt_debt.index = ind
    ax = govt_debt.plot(lw=2)
    plt.title("Government Debt to GDP (%)")
    plt.show()
